% Main content
\section{Introduction}
The Area project is a full stack consisting of a website and a mobile application.
The technologies used to create the project cannot be re-used in 2 different sections of the project.
This means that the website and the mobile app must be developed using 2 different technologies.
This also means that the server cannot use a technology used by the front (web, mobile).

The aim of Area is to Implement an IFTTT: (If this then that) action reaction type.
For example, if it is 9:00 send an e-mail to yourself reminding you to pack your lunchbox.
